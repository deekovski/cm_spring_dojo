# Spring Coding-Dojo

## Lesson 1: getting to know the application-context

### Solution: 
1. Implement ApplicationContextAware in your test to Debug the application-context
2. There is no bean named "fooService" or has the type `cm.ps.springdojo.service.FooService`
3. create new bean in `applicationContext.xml`
