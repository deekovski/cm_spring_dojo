## Lesson 3: setterbased bean-creation

### Problem: 
The `Setterbased` bean is not allowed to have an AllArgsConstructur, maybe because its a databean, or due to some guidlines we are not allowed to implement an public Constructor with all args.
But the application needs 1 Constructor `public SetterbasedBean(String attr1, String attr2)`
